# Multi-Robot Path Planning for Coverage in Cluttered and Known Environment

## Motivation

DARP [1] divides in an iterative manner the areas based on the robots initial positions on a known environment to compute a single robot spanning tree coverage (STC) on each subarea. This approach does not suit cluttered environment as STC requires cell subdivision and DARP does not take obstacles into account in the distance metrics.


## Previous Work

DARP was extended to A* DARP to take the obstacles into account, replacing the euclidean distance by the A* path length as distance metric between two cells.

An &epsilon;* based greedy single robot coverage path planner (CPP) [2] was developped. It does not require cell subdivision and is used to replace the STC initially used by DARP and A* DARP.


## Contribution

The contribution is detailled in the [report](report.pdf).

### Environment

The environment is considered as cluttered if narrow passages have the same width as the length of a grid cell. This grid cell length represents the work area of the robot and can be different than its actual footprint.

The environment is represented by a grid but each cell has connected cells list, because two free neighbour cells are not necessary connected, as they can be separated by a thin obstacle. The Movement Map below is computed based on the obstacles, robot's footprint and workspace diameters. The obstacles are built using the [Shapely python library](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/2.0.6/reference/shapely.intersects.html) and can be changed in the ```map.py``` script.
